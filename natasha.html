	<p>Natalia Alianovna "Natasha" Romanoff is a fictional character primarily portrayed by Scarlett Johansson in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise—based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name—sometimes known by her alias, Black Widow. Romanoff is a spy and an expert hand-to-hand combatant, trained in the Red Room from childhood. She eventually joins S.H.I.E.L.D. and becomes a key member and eventual leader of the Avengers until her death in Avengers: Endgame (2019).</p>
	<p>Romanoff was introduced in Iron Man 2 (2010), and became a central MCU character, appearing in nine films until making her final live-action appearance in Black Widow (2021). Johansson's portrayal of Romanoff was met with mostly positive reception. Several alternate versions of Romanoff from within the Multiverse appear in the animated series What If...? (2021), voiced by Lake Bell.</p>
